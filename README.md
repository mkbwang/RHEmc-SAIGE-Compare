# RHEmc-SAIGE-Compare
This repo offers guidance in terms of how to generate simulated phenotypes to compare the performance of RHEmc and the first step of SAIGE in terms of variance component estimation. There are also example bash scripts that help run the SAIGE and RHEmc analysis.

## Phenotype Generation

Run the file `Gen_pheno.R` file line by line. You need to make sure that you set up the right directory when running the R script. You will need the [BEDMatrix](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEDMatrix/index.html) package.
